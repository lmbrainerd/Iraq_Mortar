This particular photo-masking application is an experiment as we are attempting to model an Egyptian box coming from the collections of Museo Egizio, in Turin, Italy.

This application enables the creation of a high quality 3D model of an archaeological artefact via process known as 
photo-masking. There has been a revolution in 3D modelling in recent years and it is now relatively easy to construct 
such models from ordinary digital photographs. Isolating the object depicted in these photographs, and masking out the 
background, is an important first step to achieving high quality results. The final 3D model will be made publicly 
available and is useful not only for basic documentation purposes, but also for graphical displays in museums, for 
inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments, or for identifying different sub-styles in otherwise similar 
types of artefact (that might tell us about the date of the artefact, where it was made, or by whom).

This particular photo-masking application is about a round stone mortar with two holes on both sides. The object 
was found in Gird-i Bazar, which is part of a Neo-Assyrian settlement complex (ca. 900-600 BCE) located in the Kurdish
Autonomous Region of Iraq, province of Sulaymaniyah. The mortar was excavated in the summer of 2016 during 
archaeological investigations carried out by LMU Munich's Ancient History Department, which has been running the
excavation since 2015.

Stonemortars were, and sometimes still are, used with stone pestles to prepare ingredients or substances by 
crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder. With this crowd-sourcing project we are asking for 
your help to assist with the 3D documentation of one of these tools.


### What we want you to do

We would like people to draw a polygon around the object that they see in each photograph in order to identify its 
outline and exclude the image background. This allows the 3D modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and 
ignore irrelevant background information.

If you are interested in what our 3D completed models look like, please have a look [at our Sketchfab profile](https://sketchfab.com/micropasts).
